shiny-d3-plot
=============

experiments with d3 and r integration with shiny

Using the fine example offered by https://github.com/trestletech, build a d3 bar plot of annual performance data for the S&P 500 and the Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index.  Start with a local .csv file similar to the original example but eventually add on the ability to use live data from the web or from Axys.
